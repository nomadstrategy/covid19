Personal message about COVID-19:

A new type of virus is presently frightening the world. 
People are confused, scared and hoarding: Others are annoyed, frustrated, and angry.

What we do know is that some supplies are running out worldwide, and that stores are emptying.
Some have hoarded thousands of life-saving masks for first responders who are having to break guidelines
and re-use them due to shortages. Masks are nowhere to be found -- or at least 10x as expensive.

Those masks will save lives in the right hands, there is no question about that. What if we could
build masks that cost next to nothing and can save lives? Should we not try to work on this?
How about replacing other goods that are now scarce, like hand sanitizer, disinfectants, that can
potentially save lives by reducing infections? Can these be made at home? 

If you ask: "How serious is covid?" You will hear a very different answer, layperson,
politican, and experts all disagree. 

I think it makes sense to plan for the worst, and hope for the best. I do not see much planning, however.
I feel obligated to do something since I am stuck at home, and this is what I thought to do, but I 
cannot do it alone. I don't think any country can do this alone, to be honest.


We are all dealing with a new situation and we are doing so in different ways. 


A global pandemic is in presently worsening. By contributing our experiences, stories, research, and work efforts
as a global community, we can stand united and work through this GLOBAL problem together. 

We will gain nothing from panic. You may even be in some form of a personal quarantine if you are reading this,
please share your experience. People in your community would be interested to hear unique experiences. 

We are a global community now, with a singular enemy: the unknown. 

Let's change that.
