Covid 19 global pandemic:
    Please offer suggestions!

TLDR:

    As a global community, let's work together on COVID-19

PROJECT GOALS:

    to work together globally to provide eachother with much needed resources:

        GUIDES    (to be made as easily digestible as possible)

            -[] reports and information
                (case fatality rate/CFR, local/global infections, cured, results by severity and age)

            -[] last-ditch supplies 
                (home-made masks, respirators, and medicines for those who are dying at home)

            -[] collaborative research of all levels
                (categorized, from travel anecdotes to all research from highly speculative to strong, evidence-backed theories and treatments)


            -[] solid external resources
                (dr john campbell youtube, reddit/coronavirus etc)

            -[] requests for professional recommendations
                (ie a request for a 'understanding other people in crisis' guide etc)

            -[] preparation guides
                (worst-case to best-case recommendations, all budgets)
                ('get some elderberries, water' to 'lots of guides etc')
            
            -[] 'global timecapsule'
                (global torrent contribution by country, each choosing some songs, documents, etc, to preserve)




        -[] collaborative research of all levels
            -gather a repository of research, anecdotes, theories of all levels
                -filter and further research
                # disproven, highly speculative, speculative, theoretical, evidence-based, strongly backed by evidence, established
            
            #(those who are desperate may at their own risk *** wish to try something unproven e.g. high-dose vitamin C)


Personal message:

A new type of virus is presently frightening the world. 
People are confused, scared and hoarding: Others are annoyed, frustrated, and angry.

What we do know is that some supplies are running out worldwide, and that stores are emptying.
Some have hoarded thousands of life-saving masks for first responders who are having to break guidelines
and re-use them due to shortages. Masks are nowhere to be found -- or at least 10x as expensive.

We are all dealing with a new situation and we are doing so in different ways. 


A global pandemic is in presently worsening. By contributing our experiences, stories, research, and work efforts
as a global community, we can together overcome difficult problems together.
